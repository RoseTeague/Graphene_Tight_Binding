The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 1
s = 5*lc 
kx = pi/(5*lc)
ky = pi/(5*lc)
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 

The disorder strength, given by delta in the file disorder_potentials/DD_DP_G
was changed between 0.1 and 2.1 in intervals of 0.2. 
It can be seen that increasing the strength of disorder has the effect of 
'squashing' the tail. With a disorder strength of 0.1, the wavepacket can clearly
be identified as the case of no potential with an very small tail towards the 
left. The intensity of the wavepacket reduces as the disorder strength increases.
