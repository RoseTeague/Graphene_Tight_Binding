The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 1
s = 5*lc 
kx = pi/(5*lc)
ky = pi/(5*lc)
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 

The disorder strength was increased from 0.1 to 2.3. The plots show as the 
2D disorder strength increases, there is more 'resistance' to wavepacket 
dispersion. For delta = 0.1, the form of the final wavepacket with no 
potential is clear, with two tails, one to the left and one down, from the 
central peak. At higher values of delta, these tails become more dominant, and 
the overall wavepacket recedes towards its initial position. The 2D disorder can 
therefore be seen to enhance dispersion at the expense of propagation.
