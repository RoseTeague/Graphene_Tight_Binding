The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 1
s = 5*lc 
kx =
ky = 0
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 

The disorder strength was kept fixed at delta = 0.3
The x-direction wavevector was decreased from kx = pi/lc to pi/(10*lc). 
From the plots it can be seen that setting the y-direction wavevector to zero 
reduced the and dispersion along the y-diection. As the value of kx increases,
however, there is seen to be slightly more vertical dispersion than at very 
small values of kx.
