The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 
s = 5*lc 
kx = pi/(5*lc)
ky = pi/(5*lc)
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 

The correlation length was increased from 0.1 to 2.5. In the absence of any 
potential, the only effect this has is on the width and momentum of the 
wavepacket in relation to the size of the lattice. For small values of lc where
the width is less than the lattice size, the packet does not propagate but 
spreads out through the lattice, maintaining that hexagonal structure. As lc is
increases, the width of the packet increases and so it begins to propagate more. 
Where lc = 1.5, there is no longer any dispersion tailing off from the peak, and 
a much cleaner propagation is seen.
