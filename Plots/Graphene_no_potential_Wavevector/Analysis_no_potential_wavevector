The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 1
s = 5*lc 
kx = 
ky = 
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 

The wavevector was reduced along each direction from pi/lc to pi/(10*lc). In 
all plots, kx = ky.
For larger wavevectors (kx = ky = pi/lc) the wavepacket can be seen to interact 
more with the lattice, resulting in a separation of the final packet. However, 
as k decreases (representing longer wavelengths which cannot 'see' the lattice 
structure so much) the intereference fringes disappear and the final wavepacket
becomes more spherical.
