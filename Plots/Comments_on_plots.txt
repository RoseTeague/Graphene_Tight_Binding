The main plots shown here were run with the following parameters:

n = 200
m = 200
lc = 1
s = 5*lc
kx = pi/(5*lc)
ky = pi/(5*lc)
dt = 0.1 e-15
T = 15 fs

It can be seen that on this length scale, the 'simple' solver diverges from the 
expected results due to a numerical error which can be reduced by making the 
time step, dt, very small. The 'fast' solver, which is used for 
the rest of the plots, displays a propagating wave will disperse around the 
direction of propagation. This is determined by the values of kx and ky. In this, 
and all other plots unless specified, kx = ky, and so the packet propagates at 45
degrees. 
Under a 1D disorder potential, the dispersion is seen to change. The wavepacket 
develops a tail which streams along the x-direction only, as predicted in 
literature, however, it still displays travel in the y-direction. This 
discrepancy is likely due to a bug within the potential which, unfortunately, 
is still to be identified. 
Under a 2D disorder potential, the wavepacket spreads out and becomes messy.
