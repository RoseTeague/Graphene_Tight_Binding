The following graphs were produced using the parameters below: 

n = 500
m = 500
lc = 
s = 5*lc 
kx = pi/(5*lc)
ky = pi/(5*lc)
dt = 0.1 e-15 
T = 10 e-15 
The disorder strength was fixed at delta=0.3

The correlation length, lc, was increased from 0.1 - 2.5. From the resulting 
plots it can be seen that at small values of lc, whilst the initial width of the 
wavepacket is much smaller, the packet spreads outwards from the origin maintaining 
the hexagonal structure of the lattice. This is due to the inital wavepacket 
being smaller than the lattice structure itself. As lc increases, the final 
wavepacket becomes more linear as expected.
